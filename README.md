# Daily-Meal-Planner

## Description
For this project my group wanted to create a web app that lets users find meals for anytime of the day. Daily meal planner allows you to select the meal of the day, the protien you want and how many calories you want to intake. Once you find your desired meal you can go to the map page and put in your zipcode or address and find the closest grocery stores. This app takes a lot of the stress of away from not knowing what meal to make. I learned a lot about server apis and how to work in a group.
